# Goals (draft)

* [no null](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28106234/are-there-languages-without-null)
* built-in [logging](https://golang.org/pkg/log/)
* no literals outside of enum to force NLS/i18n and externalized constants (extreme?)
* +,-, [] operators can be applied on list and map
* control structures limited to 'if' and 'for'
* embed Java directly in [special blocks](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms973872.aspx) 
* loop label acts as implicit counter
